# Project Overview
This project involves analyzing a dataset of gadget store sales to gain insights into product performance, revenue, and profitability.
The analysis is performed using Python's Pandas library and includes data cleaning, processing, and visualization.

# Dataset Description
The dataset consists of 1350 rows and 7 columns:
- Country: The country where the product was sold
- Product Type: The type of gadget sold
- Quantity: The number of units sold
- Revenue per Product: The revenue generated per unit sold
- Cost per Product: The cost incurred per unit sold
- Order Date: The date the order was made

# Analysis and Findings
The analysis involves the following steps:
1. Data Import and Cleaning: The dataset is imported into a Pandas DataFrame and checked for data types and missing values.
2. Data Exploration: Basic properties of the dataset are checked, including the last 5 products sold.
3. Revenue, Cost, and Profit Calculation: Revenue, cost, and profit are calculated for each product by multiplying the quantity by the revenue per product, cost per product, and profit per product, respectively.
4. Sorting and Filtering: The table is sorted and filtered based on specific criteria, such as product type and country etc.
5. Pivot Tables and Visualization: Pivot tables are created to summarize key metrics, and charts are created to visualize the data.

# Key Insights
